#from now on, I'm going to do data merging in this .Rmd each week to make a complete dataset that I can then use in each blog post's .Rmd in order to do the week's analysis. This way I will have all variables easily accessible and I won't have to repeat code.

#todo: bring in state-level real income, bring in state-level and national-level polling
```
