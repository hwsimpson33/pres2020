This graphic, as well as the 538 swing state graphic replication from section, inspired me to think more carefully about what causes swings in voting share in a particular state from election to election. I decided to ask a basic question: is the fluctuation in state-level vote random? We talk a lot about which states have become safe or swing states, assuming that changes from election to election in state-level voting patterns are driven by political events and not random chance. As a preliminary check, I decided to test this hypothesis.
